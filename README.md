# Car price prediction for your car

I think most us in this world have sold a car and the problem that people do come across is trying to identify what would be the best price that would not be extremely high or low. I have build a tools that is capable of doing the following:

1. Going to public site and scrape all data available for my car brand and make (BMW 3 Series)
2. Clean up the data and make sure I have the correct data and once that step is completed I am training model based on the data that was scraped and then use that model to predict how much I can get for my car based on my cars criteria).

The features that I have trained this model is on year, price, engine size, fuel type.
